# 🌐 3D Collaborative Workspace Visualizer

> **Miro + Figma — but in immersive 3D.**  
A real-time, multiplayer 3D collaborative workspace where teams can brainstorm, design, and interact with 3D content — all inside a shared virtual environment.
---

## 🧠 Concept

Imagine stepping into your team’s whiteboard — not just viewing it, but **walking around ideas**, placing sticky notes on floating walls, dropping 3D models from CAD tools, and discussing designs in spatial voice chat — all in real time.

This is a **3D spatial productivity tool** built for remote teams working on creative, technical, or engineering projects — like architecture, game design, product prototyping, and more.

Think:  
**Miro + Figma + VR Chat = 🚀 3D Collaborative Workspace**

## 🤯 Key Features

✅ **Real-Time Multiplayer Collaboration**  
Sync user positions, drawings, and object placements across clients instantly.

✅ **Immersive 3D Environment**  
Built with `three.js` — walk, look around, and interact using keyboard/mouse or VR.

✅ **Interactive Whiteboards & Sticky Notes**  
Draw, type, drag, and resize notes anywhere in 3D space.

✅ **3D Model Support (GLTF / STL / OBJ)**  
Upload and place 3D assets — ideal for engineers, designers, and architects.

✅ **Voice Chat (WebRTC)**  
Spatial audio via peer-to-peer WebRTC connections — hear teammates based on proximity.

✅ **AI Room Assistant**  
An AI-powered helper floats in the room, answering questions, summarizing discussions, or generating ideas using LLMs (OpenAI/Phi-3).

✅ **Persistent Workspaces**  
Save and reload entire room states: notes, models, camera layout, and user data.

✅ **VR Ready (WebXR)**  
Experience the workspace in VR using WebXR — no app install needed.

✅ **Full-Stack Sync & Auth**  
JWT authentication, real-time updates via Socket.IO, and secure backend.

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Development Plan

1. ✅ **Basic 3D Scene**  
   - Grid floor, ambient + directional lighting, orbit controls.

2. ✅ **User Avatars & Join System**  
   - Spawn avatars on connect, show usernames, sync position/rotation.

3. ✅ **Whiteboards & Sticky Notes**  
   - Click to create boards, draw with mouse, add text notes.

4. ✅ **3D File Upload (GLTF/STL)**  
   - Drag & drop 3D models into the scene with `GLTFLoader`, `STLLoader`.

5. ✅ **Real-Time Sync (Socket.IO)**  
   - Sync object creation, movement, drawing strokes, and avatar state.

6. ✅ **Voice Chat (WebRTC)**  
   - Peer-to-peer audio channels per room with spatial audio hints.

7. ✅ **AI Assistant (LLM Integration)**  
   - Prompt the AI bot in-room to summarize, suggest, or explain.

8. ✅ **Save & Load Workspace**  
   - Serialize scene state (notes, models, transforms) to DB.

9. ✅ **VR Mode (WebXR)**  
   - Enable VR button for headset support (Oculus, Vive, etc.).

10. 🎁 **Bonus: Export as .glb**  
    - Export entire workspace as a single 3D file.

11. 🎁 **Session Playback**  
    - Record and replay user actions like Figma/Miro history.

12. 🎁 **Markdown in Sticky Notes**  
    - Render markdown syntax in 3D text components.

## 📦 Demo Data & Assets

- Sample 3D models from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) or [Google Poly Archive](https://poly.google.com/) (archived, but downloadable).
- Placeholder images and lorem ipsum for sticky notes.
- Test GLTF files included in `/public/models/`.

> 💡 Tip: Use `.glb` files for best performance in web.
